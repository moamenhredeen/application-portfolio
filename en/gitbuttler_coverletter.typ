Dear GitButler Team,

#v(0.5em)

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior TypeScript Developer position at GitButler. Your innovative approach to simplifying Git branch management while preserving its power strongly aligns with my passion for creating elegant, efficient software solutions.

My experience as a Fullstack Web Developer at Vinnova, where I worked with React and Node.js, has equipped me with the TypeScript and frontend skills essential for this role. Additionally, my current position as a Java Developer at Primion Technology has strengthened my expertise in distributed systems and workflow management—skills directly applicable to Git branch orchestration.

Throughout my career, I've built a versatile technical foundation spanning full stack development (React, Angular, Svelte/SvelteKit), backend systems (Spring, ASP.NET Core, Node.js), and DevOps processes. My experience modernizing build processes and automating development workflows at Primion reflects GitButler's mission to enhance developer productivity.

As someone who values clean, maintainable code and thrives on complex challenges, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to a product that could transform how developers interact with Git. My systems programming background, including work with Rust, would be valuable for ensuring GitButler performs efficiently as a desktop application with web technologies.

I look forward to discussing how my skills and passion for software craftsmanship could benefit your team.

Sincerely,

#v(2em)
