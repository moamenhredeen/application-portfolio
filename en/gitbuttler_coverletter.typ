Dear Hiring Manager,

#v(0.5em)

I am excited to apply for the Senior TypeScript Developer position at GitButler. Your mission to simplify Git branch management aligns with my passion for building efficient software solutions.

My experience as a Fullstack Web Developer at Vinnova with React and Node.js has strengthened my TypeScript expertise. At Primion, I worked on a mobile client using TypeScript and Ionic, further honing my cross-platform development skills. Additionally, my work in DevOps and workflow automation has reinforced my ability to improve developer productivity.

Beyond my professional roles, I am developing a side project using Angular, Ionic, and Node.js, deepening my knowledge of full-stack TypeScript applications—directly relevant to GitButler's desktop application.

I am eager to bring my expertise in clean, maintainable code and problem-solving to your team. Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute.
